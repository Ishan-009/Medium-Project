we have to write prisma client code  with extending accelerate in every route request controller as we need to initialize the client again and again , there is a fix that you do this in a middleware


to set and get header in hono is c.set("userId",user.id) , you can do this in middleware and pass down userId using next() by midddleware to the following req route. yu have to define extra keys and variables to context explicitly 

but to set the variable you have to define the variable userId in hono in bindings and in variables like this

export const blogRouter = new Hono<{
  Bindings: {
    DATABASE_URL: string;
    JWT_SECRET: string;
  };

  Variables: {
    userId: string; // you have to add userId variable in order to set userId property of jwt to user.id value , you have to define variable and bind it
  };
}>();

by this only you will be able to access the variable 



// npx wrangler whoami :- to check  user access details on the wrangler project 


// you can update env variable in the worker project dashboard and edit and update env variable as per the production requirement


// zod validation
we will be doing zod validation in seperate module in npm package

before mono repo people used to convert validation to the npm package and import as common module in both frontend and backend

so we will publish code as a public package to npm and then access in frontend and backend
